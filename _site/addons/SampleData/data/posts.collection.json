For the next quarter of a century, this unique aircraft roamed the globe performing its role as an intelligence gathering platform for the United States. When it was first introduced into service, it was the fastest, highest flying air-breathing jet the world had ever seen. When it retired in 1990, the same could still be said.<\/p>",
